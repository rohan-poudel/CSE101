I. Place the following algorithm time complexities in order from fastest (least number of 
comparisons) to the slowest: nlogn, n, 2**n, n**2, logn, 2n 

ANS: logn < n = 2n < nlogn < n**2 < 2**n

II. Why are divide-and-conquer algorithms often very efficient in terms of time complexity? 

ANS: Divide-and-conquer algorithms needs at most 30 comparisons to find something in a list of 1 billion items
     The worst case for linear search would be 1 billion comparisons!

III. Write in your own words 3 different examples of cases where people around you are 
giving up their privacy to use some service in exchange for a benefit. State for each 
example what data is being collected and what benefits the user receives in exchange. 

ANS: 1) Giving location data for GPS navigation, weather and traffic alerts.
     2) Giving personal data for getting deliveries
     3) Giving privacy for apps like google, facebook.



IV. In your own words, explain the two characteristics that a recursive solution must have. 
ANS:1)One or more base cases (the simplest cases) are used to stop recursion
    2)One or more a recursive calls that reduce the original problem in size, bringing it increasingly
    closer to a base case until it becomes that case
